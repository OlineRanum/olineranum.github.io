My research is focused on sign language processing, and in particular on establishing a foundation for sign language recognition in geometric deep learning. This approach utilizes 3D motion capture technologies, spatial geometry and linguistic principles. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master of Science degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam, where I am in the process of writing my thesis. 

Prior to pursuing a degree in AI, I founded and led DeepSign AS, a start-up targeting sign language technologies. This venture, comprised of an international team of six, received support and funding from the Research Council of Norway in 2021. 

My academic background is rooted in physics and astronomy, having completed a bachelor's degree at the University of Oslo. My initial master's studies at the University of Amsterdam focused on gravitational waves and astroparticle physics at the GRAPPA institute. I also briefly pursued a degree in international relations, focusing on human rights, international law, economics, and organization.

In 2021, I decided to shift my research focus from physics to AI. This transition was driven by a growing realization of the potential and importance of AI in creating social technologies and which includes those who might benefit from them the most. Growing up in a bilingual household, where Norwegian and Norwegian Sign Language were used, I got to know the challenges faced by disabled communities in connecting with society at large, and the lack of oppotunities to recive adequate support. This personal experience was further deepened due to my brother's early diagnosis with a rare neurological disorder, which limited his ability to use verbal language. 

My current research, while focusing on what could be considered a prime example of warm AI, is part of a larger purpose centered on improving societal structures for accessibility.
