## Visual Languages

Sign languages are visual, fully fledged natural languages that are produced using a structured synthesis of the hands, the body, and the face to convey meaning. Unlike spoken languages that unfold over time through sound, sign languages are three-dimensional languages expressed in the physical space around the signer. They are perceived and understood with the vision.

Sign languages serve as the primary means of communication within Deaf communities. However, sign languages are also in use by other communities including individuals with disabling hearing loss, persons with neurocognitive disorders that affect language abilities, and hearing individuals learning to sign.

The recognition and accommodation of sign languages vary significantly across the world. Contrary to the common misconception that there is a universal sign language, different countries or regions have their own unique sign language and dialects.  Although the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) mandates that governments acknowledge sign language as an official language, provide professional interpreter services, and ensure that Deaf individuals have access to education in sign language, accessibility remains a widespread issue.

## Sign Language Processing
Sign language processing (SLP) is a dynamic research area concerned with the automatic recognition, translation and production of sign languages (SL). This interdisciplinary field focuses on the development of interpretation technologies for d/Deaf and hearing communities, fostering better communication and promoting inclusivity. SLP encompasses a broad range of domains such as linguistics, natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning, animation technology, and human-computer interaction (HCI).
