-- In progress --

One of the factors that have slowed progression in developing machine translation, recognition and production models for sign languages is the absence of large, high quality annotated datasets. 

As part of our work on producing a novel pipeline for 3D sign language dataset production we did a litterature survey on the available lexical datasets for various sign languages. Some of the essential datasets are listed below. 

# Motivating the production of 3D datasets 
The natural and most common form of sign language data is presented through RGB videos. However, sign languages are three dimensional languages, and essential information might be lost through the reduction of the language to 2D. 

Almost all available data for sign languages are videos recorded with purly a frontal view. This makes generalization to new angles difficult.
